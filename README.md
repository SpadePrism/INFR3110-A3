# INFR3110-A3

GAME DESCRIPTION:

A simple 2D Platformer where your goal is to avoid obstacles and reach the goal zone! 

TUTORIAL:

Move with A & D and jump with the SPACE BAR. Enable the spawner checkbox to place death balls, or if you prefer death cubes, change to that using the dropdown! Fancy some colour to those steps? Simply select a step to activate the colour buttons and choose from green, yellow, or cyan!

If you would like to change out the DLL plugins, navigate to the appropriate DLL folder, copy the respective Modify or Restore DLL, then head into the "INFR 3110 - A3_Data" folder, select the "Plugins" Folder, and replace the existing DLL with the one you copied!

To save your button activations to a logfile.txt file, simply press the E KEY after you make any step selections.
Looking for the logfile.txt file? Navigate to the "INFR 3110 - A3_Data" folder and find it within.
